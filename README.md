# Black screensaver

This is a screensaver which was created out of a very basic need. I just wanted
a screensaver which would make the screen black on my Macbook. It's not an
option which comes included with macOS, and other existing solutions such as
[macos-blank-screensaver](https://github.com/theseal/macos-blank-screensaver)
stopped working with macOS Mojave (10.14).

Without any prior experience with XCode or Objective-C, I set out to create my
own screensaver by following a random guide I found online, and managed to do
so!


## Supported macOS versions

macOS Mojave (10.14) as that's what I'm running on my machine. I have no idea
if it might work on other machines and if it will continue working in the
future.

Not that there's much to see...

## Installation

I have added zip files with the resulting screensaver to the
[releases](https://github.com/Tenzer/black-screensaver/releases) page. If you
download one and double click the zip file, you should get at `Black.saver`.
Double click that and it will be installed and will then be visible in the list
of screensavers on your system.


## Uninstalling

Depending on if the screensaver was installed for only your user or all users
of the system, it will have been placed in either `~/Library/Screen Savers` or
`/Library/Screen Savers`. Removing the `Black.saver` folder will remove the
screensaver from your machine.
